# ExpressJS Project with MongoDB and EJS

This project showcases the implementation of a web application using ExpressJS, EJS, MongoDB, and various associated technologies. The key features demonstrated include:

- **ExpressJS and Middleware**: Utilizes ExpressJS for building a robust web application and includes custom middleware functions for various tasks.

- **EJS Templating**: Implements EJS as the templating engine for rendering dynamic views.

- **Session and Cookies using Express-Generator**: Incorporates session and cookie management using Express-Generator for enhanced user interaction.

- **MongoDB and Mongoose for Data Storage**: Leverages MongoDB as the database and utilizes Mongoose as the ODM for effective data storage and retrieval.

- **Flash Messages for User Feedback**: Implements flash messages to provide informative feedback to users.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Demonstrates user authentication using Passport.js, ensuring secure access to protected routes.

- **Data Association using MongoDB Models**: Establishes data association between two MongoDB models - `User` and `Post`.
